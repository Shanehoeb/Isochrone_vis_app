# Isochrone Project - Communicating Data & Statistics

## Description

Isochrones delimit lines of equal travel time from an origin. They are important to investigate how well connected a location is, and have many applications, from improving transport networks to any location-based optimisation, This project presents a visualization tool that plots isochrones from an origin using a set of user-defined parameters. The isochrones are generated using the TravelTime API (https://traveltime.com/). 


## Usage
To use the interactive map, run the server.R file. This will generate a window presenting a map and the user menu on the left, as seen in the picture below.
