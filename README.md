# Isochrone Project - Communicating Data & Statistics

## Description

Isochrones delimit lines of equal travel time from an origin. They are important to investigate how well connected a location is, and have many applications, from improving transport networks to any location-based optimisation, This project presents a visualization tool that plots isochrones from an origin using a set of user-defined parameters. The isochrones are generated using the TravelTime API \url{https://traveltime.com/}{a}.
